Maya to Unreal Alembic Export Tools

I've worked on many cinematic projects in Unreal Engine. Most notably this one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNJtPFXUnm4).

With every project, the team groans as the time comes to export all the animation from Maya and import it into Unreal.
The tools I've made allow the process to be a lot quicker and less technical upfront.

This tool uses ALEMBIC CACHES as the file type of choice. This is because alembics are the most versatile for cinematic animation, as there is no limit on your deformers, like with FBX.

## Features

* Quickly identify desired objects for export within Maya
* Export those objects with the necessary alembic export options that work best in Unreal
* Maya UI for exporting one or multiple export locations
* Unreal UI with a simple drag-n-drop window to batch import animation
